## Dev notes

Its been a while since I wrote most of this code and I don't really
remember all the details of what is going on everywhere.  So I made this
document to record any new investigations into changing things
and what issues I found.

Could use github issues/wiki for this kind of note-taking but I tend to
lose track of information in there.  However I will cite any issues that
are relevant here.
